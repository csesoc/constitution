To assist associations develop their constitution, NSW Fair Trading has prepared a model constitution, which covers the matters required by law. 
Any changes made to the model constitution will automatically apply to all associations that have adopted the model constitution, where no changes have been made by CSESoc.

The model constitution is © State of New South Wales through NSW Fair Trading, 2016. It has been modified by CSESoc.
