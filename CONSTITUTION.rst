About the Constitution
----------------------

The constitution of an incorporated association forms the structure within which the Association operates. 
CSESoc has created this document as a combination of the following:

- The Constitution of the Unincorporated Association that incorporated to form CSESoc (the "CSESoc Constitution")
- The Model Constitution provided by NSW Fair Trading (the "Model Constitution")

To assist associations develop their constitution, NSW Fair Trading has prepared a model constitution, which covers the matters required by law. 
Any changes made to the model constitution will automatically apply to all associations that have adopted the model constitution, where no changes have been made by CSESoc.

The model constitution is © State of New South Wales through NSW Fair Trading, 2016. It has been modified by CSESoc.

This constitution was prepared by Tom Kunc (tom@tfpk.dev) with thanks

#. Nominations must remain open until at least the later of:

   #. one calendar week after nominations open; or

#. Nominations must be entered and seconded by two (2) full members, one of whom must be the nominee.

#. The Co-Presidents shall maintain the official list of nominees during the nomination period, and upon its closure, forward the list to the School of CSE, who shall run the official election. The list of full members who have been removed from the society will be sent to the School of CSE by the Secretary on this same day.

   #. Only elections run by the School of CSE shall be recognised. 
   #. The School of CSE may nominate a person they think is fit and proper to manage the election. If they do so, that person should setup the election and calculate the votes, then transmit them to the School of CSE.
   #. The Executive may choose that the list be made publicly available during the nomination period. If they choose to do so, it must be on the Society website. 
   #. The election will run for at least three academic days.

#. If there is a tie for any Executive position between candidates, the outgoing executives shall have a casting vote in the election. 
#. Upon finalising of the election results, they must be pronounced to the membership within one (1) business day.

   #. In order to be appointed to an executive position, winner(s) of the election must accept their role and the motion to appoint them has to pass at the Annual General Meeting meeting, or at an Extraordinary General Meeting.

#. Only full members are entitled to vote for the Executive. 
#. Voting is to be confidential and anonymous with the exception of,

   #. In the event of a full member being prevented by the School of CSE from accessing the voting site, votes shall be submitted to the first executive member not running in the election in the following list; the Co-Presidents, the Secretary, the Treasurer, the Arc Delegate, the GEDI Officer, the Vice President (External), the Vice President (Internal), the Vice President (Technical). If all of the above are running in the election the vote should be submitted to the School Manager. The executive member (or School Manager) will then submit the anonymised vote to the member in charge of maintaining the list of nominees.

#. Votes will be counted using a modified version of the “single transferable vote” electoral system, a variant of the instant-runoff preferential voting system. 

   #. For each vacancy, within each position:

      #. Count the votes for that position according to the standard "single transferable vote" algorithm, treating anyone who was already elected to that position, or who preferenced that position lower than one they were elected to, as if they had not run. The candidate who reaches the quota of votes as determined by the Droop quota for that position is elected to that position.
      #. Should there not be anyone eligible to hold that position, the position shall be declared vacant.
   #. Each person should then be declared elected to the position which they preferenced highest. All other positions to which they were elected should be declared vacant. 
   #. Continue the above steps until they result in a stable allocation.

::

   Explanatory Note: This process is unfortunately complex, due to two difficult factors:
    - Two co-presidents are elected, and
    - People can run for multiple positions.
    
    These two factors together can cause annoying side-effects.
    
   To make this simple, basically:
    - You run two co-president elections -- the first time you just elect someone, the second time you re-run the election, but pretend the winning co-pres didn't run. 
    - People get their highest preference of position. If someone moves around, due to their preferences, there can be a "chain-effect" of people moving.
    
   This might result in a sub-optimal ordering. Unfortunately, the only alternative is to contact people before the election to make a deal, but this can result in some really weird edge cases (You might end up in a situation where someone's choice of position turns out to be a choice between two other people being elected, or where choices are weirdly dependent). It seems better to ensure everyone is maximally happy with their position, and re-run other elections in an EGM (sorry).
   
   All the best for your elections, ~tfpk
